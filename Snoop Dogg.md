## My favorite rapper is Snoop Dogg

Snoop Dogg is my favorite rapper, and it's easy to see why. He has the best:

* Flow
* Style
* Swagger

Even though he does some questionable things, I still think he's a good guy.

My favorite Snoop Dogg quote is:
>"When I'm not longer rapping, I want to open up an ice cream parlor and call myself Scoop Dogg."

Pretty good stuff.
