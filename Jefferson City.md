## Jefferson City

I am from Jefferson City. Jefferson City is the capitol of Missouri. I like Jefferson City because it is where my family is from, but I often think that it is boring.

Jefferson City has been the capital of Missouri since 1821.

The best part about Jefferson City is the old state penitentiary.
